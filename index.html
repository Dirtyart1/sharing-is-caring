      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p> Take It Back its a non- profit campaign created to help persevere skateparks and to stop the destruction of them, also to show the effects that it has on the community. The skatepark that I will be focusing on more is Southbank. The reason behind this campaign is that I am a skateboarder myself and  when you take away something that helps to create positivity in a community,  it may lead to negative outcomes. I believe that destroying skateparks destroys a community and hopefully you to feel a passionate about this cause as I do.</p>

      <h2> Benefits of a skatepark!</h2>

      <h3> 1. Skateparks reducing  delinquency </h3>
      <h4>The sigma surrounding skateparks is that they harvest crime and other illicit activities. Just like any other sporting activity  there will be an occasional “bad seed”, but by providing designated spaces for positive activities, it is just that step easy to help decrease unlawful behaviour among youth. When youth have nothing to do or nowhere to go; is when crime and other illicit activities can thrive.</h4>

      <h3> 2. Health benefits of skateboarding
</h3>
      <h4>The most important reason for anyone participating in action sports is that it keeps you healthy and physically fit. Finding a fun and exciting activity for kids to do will get them off the couch and start to keep them in shape as this vital for the youth of this nation, especially in this time of a national health crisis.
</h4>
<h4>It’s great exercise, especially for your legs, but that’s not why I do it. It’s a lifestyle. It’s an   addiction. But it’s also therapeutic. When you’re doing tricks, hanging out with your mates, you forget about all your troubles and you just have fun.                      source:<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/my-workout-skateboard-wings-chan">The Guardian</a> Saturday 25 February 2017
</h4>

      <h3> 3. Positive economic impacts
</h3>
      <h4>For decades skateboarding has been a youth attraction therefore its started taking over on the youth marketing. Today skateboarding has become a  serious business with lucrative video games, television shows, and brand names that launch dozens of product lines. With the majority of this promoting, more children than any other time in recent memory are anxious to figure out how to skate. The request is tremendous and skateparks are the place to begin.
</h4>

      <h3> 4. Skateparks reduce damage to private property
</h3>
      <h4>Skateboarding will continue to happen with or without a skateparks therefore by not supporting our local youth with a skatepark, it doesn’t mean they’ll quit skating. It just means we are putting them at risk of injury and unwanted encounters with law enforcement.
</h4>
      <h4>A majority of the deadly accidents that happen while people are skateboarding involve a motor vehicle. The most interesting terrain for skateboarding is found in the streets and sidewalks. A skatepark should be the safest place to skate but for it to be effective it must be more interesting than what’s out “in the wild.”</h4>
